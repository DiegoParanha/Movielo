As an enthusiast who loves to keep track of my favorite movies and TV shows, I often found myself frustrated with the lack of a centralized location to store my watch list. I would write down titles on random scraps of paper, save them in various note-taking apps, or just try to remember them off the top of my head. That's when I decided to take matters into my own hands and create a system that worked for myself/ friends. I researched different apps and websites, and tested out several options before settling on one that I felt was user-friendly and met all of my needs. Now, I have a single location to store my watch list, and I can easily access it from my phone(eventually) or computer whenever I need to update or reference it. It may seem like a small thing, but having a dedicated place to store my watch list has made a big difference in my enjoyment of TV and movies.
